# buzzline-06-pinkston

The goal of this project is to analyze Average U.S. Life Expectancy from 1900 - 2018 and visualize that data on a live chart. It will also break down the average life expectancy by gender and compare those break downs to the total average.

The project uses a producer script to load data from three CSV files, converts the data into JSON messages, and then stores them in a Kafka topic. A consumer script reads the JSON topic, extracts the messages, and then renders the data on a live-updating chart.

The JSON messages will look like this:
```
{'year': 1900, 'total': 47.3, 'female': 48.3, 'male': 46.3}
```

This project requires the use of GitHub, Python 3.11, VS Code, Apache Kafka, and WSL (if using a Windows machine). It is assumed that the user already has a GitHub account, and that their machine is setup to run and process Python projects/code through VS Code and that Apache Kafka is also setup to run.

The expected outcome is to have a combo bar/line chart that updates live as data is read into it. There is also a periodic analytics report that will be displayed every decade (1910, 1920, 1930...).

## Copy this Project

1. Copy/fork this project into your GitHub account.
2. Rename the project as you desire.
3. Clone the project down to your machine and open in VS Code.

## Task 1. Start Kafka (using WSL if on a Windows machine)

If Windows, open a PowerShell terminal in VS Code and enter the following command:

```powershell
wsl
```

At the bash prompt, enter the following commands:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/prepare_kafka.sh
scripts/prepare_kafka.sh
cd ~/kafka
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties
```
** KEEP THIS TERMINAL OPEN!** Kafka is running and needs to stay active.

For detailed instructions, see [SETUP_KAFKA](SETUP_KAFKA.md)

## Task 2. Setup/Manage Local Project Virtual Environment

Open a new terminal in VS Code:

### Windows
```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Mac/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Task 3. Start the Kafka JSON Producer

Open a new terminal in VS Code (this can be the same terminal as Task 2):

### Windows
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m producers.avg_producer_pinkston
```

### Mac/Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.avg_producer_pinkston
```

## Task 4. Start the Kafka JSON Consumer

Open a new terminal in VS Code (for a total of three terminal windows):

### Windows
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m consumers.avg_consumer_pinkston
```

### Mac/Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.avg_consumer_pinkston
```

## Stop the Continuous Process

To kill the terminal, press CTRL + C. This works in the powershell/bash terminals as well as the WSL terminal.

## Look for the Periodic Analytics Report

There is a periodic analytics report that runs in the Consumer terminal every decade (1910, 1920, 1930...). As such, it is best viewed if the Consumer terminal is not split.

The analytics report will look like this:
```
==================================================
üìä DECADE REPORT: 1900-1909
--------------------------------------------------
Avg. Life Expectancy: Total = 49.5, Female = 51.2, Male = 47.9
Lowest Life Expectancy: 1900 (Total = 47.3, Female = 48.3, Male = 46.3)
Highest Life Expectancy: 1909 (Total = 52.1, Female = 53.8, Male = 50.5)
Gender Gap (Avg.): 3.2 years
‚ö†Ô∏è  Significant drop(s) detected in year(s): 1904, 1910
==================================================
```
